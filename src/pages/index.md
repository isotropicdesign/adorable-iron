    text: |-
      Your clients need to be able to quickly review your work, read about your firm and contact you for more information. Our sites do that by leveraging simplicity and good design.

      On the backend, architects should be able to add new portfolio entries, publish blog posts and change page text by themselves. We build our sites on a Wordpress CMS and design the backend to be as user friendly as the frontend.
